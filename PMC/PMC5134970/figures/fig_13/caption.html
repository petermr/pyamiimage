Overview of DMNT and TMTT Synthesis in Maize.

The first steps of the pathways for the synthesis of the maize homoterpenes DMNT and TMTT are catalyzed by the terpene synthase TPS2, which converts GDP, FDP, and GGDP to the corresponding tertiary alcohols. The second steps, which are the oxidative degradations, are catalyzed by two P450 monooxygenases, CYP92C5 and CYP92C6. OPP, diphosphate.
