Terpenoid biosynthesis. Terpenoid biosynthesis is divided into two phases, 1) terpene scaffold generation and 2) terpene scaffold functionalization. Representative examples are shown with the modifications installed in the tailoring step highlighted in red. MEP: 2-C-methyl-á´…-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway, MVA: mevalonic acid pathway, IPP: isopentenyl pyrophosphate, DMAPP: dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, GPS: geranyl pyrophosphate synthase, GPP: geranyl pyrophosphate, FPS: farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, FPP: farnesyl pyrophosphate, GGPS: geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, GGPP: geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, GFPS: geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and GFPP geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate.
