Synopsis of terpene biosynthesis in yeast indicating the genes involved and the metabolic engineering interventions employed. Upregulated yeast genes indicated indicated in green, downregulated yeast genes in red. Genes whose products have been fused or attached to a synthetic protein scaffold are denoted with supersripted (f). Enzymes with product yield or specificity improved or altered by protein engineering are indicated by superscripted (e). (CPP, copalyl diphosphate; CDS, copalyl diphosphate synthase; DTS, diterpene synthase; MTS, monoterpene synthase; SeACS(L641P), Salmonella enterica acetyl-CoA synthase mutant L641P; AtoB, acetoacetyl-CoA synthase/thiolase).
