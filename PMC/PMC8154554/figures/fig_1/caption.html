Engineering strategies to improve amorphadiene production in B. subtilis. Four modules were engineered, including increasing MEP pathway gene expression, decreasing competing pathway gene expression, engineering of terpene synthase, and regulation of TCA cycle metabolism by employing either weak or strong promoters.
