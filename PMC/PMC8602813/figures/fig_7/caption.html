Phytocannabinoids and terpenoids biosynthesis pathways. Fertilization affects the MEP pathway in an enzymatic step upstream to GPP synthase. MEP, Methylerythritol phosphate; MVA, Mevalonate; G3P, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DMAPP, Dimethylallyl diphosphate; IPP, Isopentenyl diphosphate; GPP, Geranyl diphosphate; FPP, Farnesyl diphosphate; GPPs, GPP synthase; FPPS, FPP synthase; TPSs, Terpene synthases.
