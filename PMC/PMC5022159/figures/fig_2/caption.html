Astaxanthin biosynthesis and negative feedback regulation by ergosterol in X. dendrorhous. Astaxanthin is biosynthesized from acetyl-CoA through the pathway consists of the mevalonate, terpene, Î²-carotene and astaxanthin biosynthetic pathways. Astaxanthin biosynthesis was inhibited through negative feedback regulation by ergosterol synthesized by CYP61 gene product. IPP isopentenyl-pyrophosphate, DMAPP dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate, GPP geranyl-pyrophosphate, FPP farnesyl-pyrophosphate, GGPP geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, HMGS HMG-CoA synthase, HmgR HMG-CoA reductase, CrtE geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthase, CrtS astaxanthin synthase. IPP and DMAPP are the isoprenoid building blocks and prenyltransferases generate GPP, FPP and GGPP, the common precursors of monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15) and diterpenoids (C20), respectively. Carotenoids (C40) such as astaxanthin are constructed by condensation of two molecules of GGPP
