A model for biosynthesis of terpenes via the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the plastidic 2-C-methyl erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, indicating that a high degree of pathway crosstalk can occur. Recent data indicate that the enzyme encoded by MtEBOS functions solely in the synthesis of monoterpenes, primarily (E)-?-ocimene. The indicated enzymes are: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and individual terpene synthases (TPS). The indicated precursors are: isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), dimethyl allyl diphosphate (DMAPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). The dashed arrow represents more than one step (figure adapted from Bede et al. 2006).
