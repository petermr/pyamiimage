Expression pattern of genes in the MEP and MVA pathways of two Freesia cultivars. Gene expression levels in the fully opened flowers of Red RiverÂ® (red flower) and Ambiance (white flower) are represented by color gradations. The comparison and assignment of the TPSs in the MEP and MVA pathways is based on homology alignment. AACT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; CMK, 4-(cytidine 59-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; DXS, DXP synthase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; GPPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; HDS, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase; HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase; HMGS, HMG-CoA synthase; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; IDS, isoprenyl diphosphate synthase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; MECPS, ME-CDP synthase; MPDC, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase; MVK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; TPS, terpene synthase.
