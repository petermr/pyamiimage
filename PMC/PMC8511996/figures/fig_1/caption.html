Terpenes and terpenoids are the most common constituents of EOs. The biosynthesis of these compounds in plants occurs via two main pathways: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastids. Both pathways produce the C5 precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are condensed via geranyl/farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase to give the C10 (geranyl diphosphate, GPP), C15 (farnesyl diphosphate, FPP), and C20 (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) precursors for isoprenoid production. Depending on the number of carbons, isoprenoids are grouped in monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30), etc., with the first two groups being the main constituents of EOs. Monoterpenes and diterpenes tend to be formed in the plastids, where unique cyclases produce the ring structures. Aromatic compounds, including phenylpropanoids, are less common and are derived mainly from the shikimate pathway, but a few phenols, such as carvacrol and cuminaldehyde, are derived from terpene biosynthesis by desaturation. The graphical representation of MVA and MEP pathways are adapted and re-drawn from Vickers et al. [27]. MVA pathway enzymes abbreviations: AAT, acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase; HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase; MK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; FPPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. MEP pathway enzymes abbreviations: DXS, deoxyxylulosephosphate synthase; DXR, deoxyxylulosephosphate reductoisomerase; CMS, diphosphocytidylmethylerythriol synthase; CMK, diphosphocytidylmethylerythriol kinase; MDS, methylerythriol cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase; HDR hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.
