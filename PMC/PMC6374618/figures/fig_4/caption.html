Schematic relationships between the wound-induced signal transduction mechanisms for the sesquiterpene biosynthesis and regulation in Aquilaria species for the agarwood production. External stimuli trigger the Ca2+ signaling pathway and induce the defense responses of Aquilaria species via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) pathway, ethylene (ET) signals, Jasmonic acid (JA) signals, and salicylic acid (SA) signals. MeJA treatment triggers H2O2 production that can induce programmed cell death (PCD) and increase the sesquiterpene synthesis. These signaling molecules activate the transcription factors such as MYB, MYC, and WRKY, which will bind to the cis-element on the promoter of terpenes biosynthesis genes in the mevalonic acid (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways and also the downstream terpene synthase genes (TPs). Direct and indirect interactions are shown as solid and dotted lines, respectively.
