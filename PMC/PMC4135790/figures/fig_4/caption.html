Metabolic pathways of VOC production in Aspergillus fumigatus: terpene biosynthesis and terpenoid metabolites. The production of terpenes originates in the synthesis of mevalonic acid. In this study, several drugs were used to interfere with terpenoid biosynthesis (pravastatin, alendronate, voriconazole). In two terpene synthase mutant strains, the production of specific groups of terpenes is suppressed (AFUA_8G00520Δ mutant, sesquiterpenes; AFUB_062550Δ mutant, diterpenes). Bold numbers in parentheses correspond to the entries in Table 1 and the GC peaks shown in Fig. 1. CoA, coenzyme A; PP, pyrophosphate.
