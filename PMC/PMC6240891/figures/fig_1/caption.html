Glandular trichome and mono and sesquiterpenes biosynthetic pathways in Pelargonium. (A) Capitate secretory gland with a stack (s) constituted of several cells and surrounded by a head secretory cell (sc). Terpenes accumulate in the subcuticular space (ss). Bar scale = 10 μm. (B) Biosynthetic pathways of mono and sesquiterpenes. Enzymatic steps in the yellow box correspond to enzymes functionally characterised in this study. Enzymatic steps upstream of terpene biosynthesis are in bold letters.
