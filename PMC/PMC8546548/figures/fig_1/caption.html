Sodium-induced changes in Thraustochytrium sp. metabolism (adapted from reference 4). The schematic pathways illustrate terpene synthesis from glucose or fatty acid (FA) Î²-oxidation, and the changes that occur in Thraustochytrium sp. metabolism under sodium (NaCl) supplementation growth conditions. Significantly increased levels of metabolites and enzymes are shown in green, while significantly decreased levels of metabolites or enzymes, determined by comparative proteomics and metabolomics, are shown in pink. For clarity, numerous steps were omitted (dashed arrows) to highlight the identified changes. The red asterisk indicates the rate-limiting enzyme in both growth conditions, determined by in silico analysis of local thermodynamics.
