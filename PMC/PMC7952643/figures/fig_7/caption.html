Summary of the significant differences in gene expression of the terpene biosynthesis in the leaves of two tomato cultivars. Genes are shown in italics, red-colored expressed higher in the resistant cultivar (Ofir) than in the susceptible cultivar (Shiran). Volatiles with red background produced more in Ofir, and volatiles with blue background produced more in Shiran. Gene and volatiles identified in this work are shown in bold. CPT, cis-prenyltransferase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; E,E-FPP, trans-farnesyl diphosphate; FPPS, E,E-FPP synthase; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGPPS, GGPP synthase; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; NPP, neryl diphosphate; NNPP, nerylneryl diphosphate; SSU, small subunit of GGPPS; TPS, terpene synthase; Z,Z-FPP, cis-farnesyl diphosphate.
