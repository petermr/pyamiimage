(A) Biosynthesis of cis- and trans-prenyldiphosphates.

(B) Chemical structures of some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes synthesized by tomato TPSs.

(C) The general pathway in plants to the synthesis of ent-kaurene (a precursor of gibberellins) from GGPP and the synthesis of Z-abienol from GGPP in N. tabacum.
