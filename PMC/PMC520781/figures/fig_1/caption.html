Known cyclization steps in labdane-related diterpenoid biosynthesis in rice. Reactions catalyzed by class II (tpsII) or class I (tpsI) terpene synthases are indicated, along with the corresponding classes of natural products derived from each of the named polycyclic hydrocarbon structures (dashed arrows indicate multiple enzymatic steps).
