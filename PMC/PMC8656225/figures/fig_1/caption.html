The pathway of plant terpenes biosynthesis. Terpenes are synthesized from two precursors generated by the cytosolic mevalonate acid (MVA) and plastid methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GPPS, GPP synthase; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; FPPS, FPP synthase; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGPPS, GGPP synthase; and TPS, terpene synthase.
