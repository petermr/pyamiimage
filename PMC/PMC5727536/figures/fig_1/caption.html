The MEP pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants. Seven enzymes participate in the MEP pathway. HDS and HDR are the enzymes that regulate the last two steps in terpenoid metabolism in the MEP pathway. Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) as a precursor for the downstream terpene biosynthesis and the difference between the two is formation mechanisms of IPP and its isomer diallylene pyrophosphate (DMAPP). Geranyhlgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) is produced by plastidic GGPP synthase (GGPS) and serves as a precursor for metabolic branches, including chlorophylls, carotenoids.
