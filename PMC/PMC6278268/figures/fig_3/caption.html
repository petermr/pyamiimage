Schematics of the putative terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and the expression level of identified genes from S. barbata. (A) the putative terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in S. barbata. Numbers in the brackets indicate the gene family numbers of each enzyme. (B) a clustered heat map for the 33 terpenoid backbone genes and 14 TPS genes with log-2 transformed FPKM value in root (RT), flower (FL), and aerial parts (AP). Purple marked enzymes are involved in the MVA pathway, and blue marked enzymes are involved in the MEP pathway. The newly identified enzyme IPK in alternative MVA pathway is highlighted in purple.
