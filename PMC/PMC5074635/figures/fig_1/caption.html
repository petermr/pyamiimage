Simplified VOC metabolic network in plant cells. All carbons of plant VOCs are generally derived from plant photosynthesis. The enzymes investigated in this study are highlighted in red, and dashed lines indicate the involvement of multiple enzymatic reactions. For clarity, only biosynthetic pathways for terpenoids, benzenoids, and short/medium-chain alcohols/aldehydes are shown. Abbreviations for enzymes are as follows: AACT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; CMK, 4-(cytidine 5â€²-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; DXS, DXP synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; HDS, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase; HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase; HMGS, HMG-CoA synthase; HPL, hydroperoxide lyase; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; IDS, isoprenyl diphosphate synthase; ISO, isomerase; LOX, lipoxygenase; MCS, ME-CDP synthase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; MDD, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase; MVK, mevalonate kinase; PAAS, phenylacetaldehyde synthase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; TPS, terpene synthase. Abbreviations for chemicals are as follows: CDP-ME, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol; CDP-MEP, CDP-ME 2-phosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; HMBPP, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; ME-CDP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate; MVP, mevalonate 5-phosphate; MVPP, mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate.
