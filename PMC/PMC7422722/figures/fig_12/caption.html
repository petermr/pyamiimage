Terpene biosynthesis pathway in tomato. Terpene precursors are synthesised by the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. The prenyl diphosphate substrates are labelled with clouds. C5, C10, C15, C20 compounds and their related enzymes are shown in green, red, light blue and orange, respectively. Enzymes characterised in this work are shown in bold. CPP, copalyl diphosphate; CPT, cis‐prenyltransferase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; E,E‐FPP, trans‐farnesyl diphosphate; FPPS, E,E‐FPP synthase; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGPPS, GGPP synthase; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; NPP, neryl diphosphate; NNPP, nerylneryl diphosphate; SSU, small subunit of GGPPS; TPS, terpene synthase; TPT, trans‐prenyltransferase; Z,Z‐FPP, cis‐farnesyl diphosphate.
