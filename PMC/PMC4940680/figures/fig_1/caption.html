Terpene biosynthetic pathways and their subcellular compartmentalization in plants. Thick arrows denote the classical understanding of terpenoid synthesis compartmentalization among cytosol and plastid (Bohlmann et al., 1998b; Chen et al., 2011; Tholl and Lee, 2011), reflecting the circumstance that monoterpene and diterpene synthases harboring a chloroplast-targeting peptide are functionally active in plastids and sesquiterpene synthases lacking the target peptide are active in cytosol. However, recent findings of the capacity for multi-substrate use of several mono, sesqui-, and, diterpene synthases suggest that when substrate becomes available, several cytosolic “sesquiterpene” synthases could also operate as monoterpene synthases, and analogously, multi-substrate “monoterpene” and “diterpene” synthases could operate as sesquiterpene synthases in plastids (denoted by thin arrows). In addition, terpenoid synthesis can also potentially occur in mitochondria (Nagegowda, 2010; Tholl and Lee, 2011; Dong et al., 2016). For instance, targeting linalool/(E)-nerolidol synthase (FaNES1) from Fragaria ananassa (Table ​(Table11 for protein specifics) to the mitochondria led to the production of (E)-nerolidol and homoterpene 4,8-dimethyl nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Kappers et al., 2005). DMADP, dimethylallyl diphosphate (C5); MEP pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway; IDP, isopentenyl diphosphate (C5); FDP, farnesyl diphosphate (C15); GDP, geranyl diphosphate (C10); GGDP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20); NDP, neryl diphosphate (C10).
