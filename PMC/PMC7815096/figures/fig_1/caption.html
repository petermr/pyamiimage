Pathway of terpene biosynthesis.
(A) IPP and DMAPP are first formed from the mevalonate pathway. IPP and DMAPP are the substrates for isoprenyl disphosphate synthases (GPPS, FPPS, and GGPPS). IDSs produce isoprenyl diphosphates of varying lengths, depending on the number of IPP units added. Isoprenyl diphosphates (GPP, FPP, and GGPP) are themselves the substrates used by TPSs to make terpenes of various sizes. For example, monoterpene synthases produce monoterpenes, such as ocimene, from GPP. For illustration, (E,E)-Î±-farnesene is used as a representative sesquiterpene, and phytol as a diterpene. (B) Proposed biosynthetic pathway in H. melpomene. Reciprocal best BLAST hits are highlighted in bold. IDSs are in red and their products, isoprenyl diphosphates, in blue.
