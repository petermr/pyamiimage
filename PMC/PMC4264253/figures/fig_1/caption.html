Metabolic pathway from glucose to astaxanthin in X. dendrorhous . The pathway consists of the glycolytic pathway and mevalonate, terpene, Î²-carotene and astaxanthin synthetic pathways. IPP, isopentenyl-pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl-diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate; AcaT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HmgS, HMG-CoA synthase; HmgR, HMG-CoA reductase; CrtE, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase; CrtS, astaxanthin synthase. IPP and DMAPP are the isoprenoid building blocks and prenyltransferases generate GPP, FPP and GGPP, the common precursors of monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15) and diterpenoids (C20), respectively. Carotenoids (C40) such as astaxanthin are constructed by condensation of two molecules of GGPP.
