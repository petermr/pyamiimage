Outline of terpenoid biosynthesis. The schematic diagram depicts the reactions carried out by short-chain IDS1 from P. abies. The five-carbon building blocks IDP and DMADP, produced by the plastidial MEP pathway, are the substrates for IDS1. Sequential condensations of DMADP with one to three molecules of IDP mediated by IDS form GDP, FDP, or GGDP. The different prenyl diphosphates are then converted into representatives of the different terpene classes: GDP to monoterpenes and GGDP to diterpenes and tetraterpenes. FDP is produced by IDS1 as an intermediate but is not released. OPP, diphosphate moiety.
