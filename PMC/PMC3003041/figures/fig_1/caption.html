Schematic illustration of the reactions catalyzed by head-to-head terpene synthases: CrtM, SQS, and PSY. All reactions involve an initial C1′-2,3 cyclopropanation step. The end products of the biosynthetic pathways are highly varied and include sterols (cholesterol, ergosterol) and carotenoids (staphyloxanthin, β-carotene).
