Hypothetical scheme of the terpene pathway in E. benthamii autotetraploids. Solid arrows indicated multiple enzymatic and transport steps. Red boxes indicate the role of chromosome set doubling in terpene biosynthesis. Long dashes represent the possible crosstalk between cytosol and chloroplast of the precursor IPP. MTPs are imported to chloroplast and use the MEP products (IPP and GPP) to form the major monoterpenes. STPs use the MVA products (IPP and FPP) to create sesquiterpenes in cytosol. Abberviations: TPS, terpene synthase gene family; MTPs, monoterpene synthases; STPs, sesquiterpene synthases; MVA, mevalonic acid; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethilallyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; MEP, methylerythritol 4-phosphate; GlyAld-3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
