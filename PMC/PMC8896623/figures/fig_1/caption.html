Loss of CHI1 in the af mutant results in higher expression of tVI-GT-expressed genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and lower expression of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. A, Metabolic scheme of the flavonoid pathway (orange), MEP pathway (blue), mevalonate pathway (gray), and terpenoid-specific reactions (green). B, Heatmap representation of the relative transcript abundance of genes involved in flavonoid, MEP, mevalonate, and terpenoid-specific pathways. The color code depicts the relative expression level of a given gene in af, CHI4, and CHI9 GTs normalized to the highest expression value among genotypes, with the cut-off for expression level set at 50 transcripts per kilobase million. The complete list of gene identifiers and expression levels is provided in Supplemental Dataset S1.
