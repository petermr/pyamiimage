Summary of the terpene and cannabinoid biosynthetic pathways in cannabis plants. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway occurs in the plastid and generates isoprenoid pre-cursors, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. IPP and DMAPP can be used to produce hemiterpenes and geranyl diphosphate (GPP), which can lead to monoterpene and diterpene synthesis. GPP combined with olivetolic acid generated from fatty acids initiates the cannabinoid biosynthesis pathway starting with the production of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and subsequent acidic cannabinoids, including cannabidiolic aicd (CBDA), cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), catalysed by respective cannabinoid synthase enzymes produced by the plant. A percentage of the native acidic cannabinoids metabolise through decarboxylation to yield non-acidic by-products, e.g., cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene (CBC), and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); the latter of which can be further metabolised to cannabinol (CBN). The cytosolic mevalonate (MEV) pathway also produces DMAPP and IPP from acetoacetate-CoA-derived precursors to generate farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which can be used to generate sesqui- and triterpenes. Terpenes can be converted to terpenoids via the P450 enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum. The production of mono-, sesqui-, di-, and triterpenes involves reactions catalysed by a multitude of terpene synthase enzymes expressed by the plant to yield an abundance of different terpene compounds. Therefore, the cannabinoid and terpene profile of a cannabis plant is largely determined by the expression of its synthase enzymes. “Cannabis Leaves Weed Png” by Clipart.info is licenced under CC BY 4.0.
