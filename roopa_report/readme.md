# ROOPA'S INTERIM REPORT

I joined CEVOpen in mid-January 2022 and formally continued as an Intern from the first-week of February.  The following is the work that I have done during this period.

## [Pyamiimage](https://github.com/petermr/pyamiimage.git)
I am working majorly on the image analysis tool called Pyamiimage as an Alpha-tester. Here, the terpene and terpene synthase pathway images are analysed using an optical character recognition tool.
This would help us in curating terpene and terpene sythase dictionaries later.

- Alpha-testing

   Analysing if the output is accurete and reporting errors as issues in Github is involved in Alpha-testing. Likewise, testing the tool using sample images, data cleaning manually, using the Fuzzywuzzy matching also plays a key role here.

- [Dictionaries](https://github.com/petermr/pyamiimage/tree/main/dictionaries)  

  Making dictionaries from the image analysis output.
